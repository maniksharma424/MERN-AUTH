MERN Authentication

Welcome to the MERN Authentication repository! This repository provides a basic authentication setup for MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack projects. It offers a simple and efficient way to integrate login, logout, registration, profile retrieval, and profile updating functionalities into your frontend.

Features
Login: Allow users to securely log in to your application.
Logout: Provide an easy way for users to log out of their accounts.
Registration: Enable new users to create accounts and join your platform.
Profile Retrieval: Retrieve user profiles with ease.
Profile Updating: Allow users to update their profile information.
Technologies Used
Express: A robust and flexible web application framework for Node.js that simplifies API development.
bcrypt.js: A library used for password hashing to enhance security.
cookie-parser: Enables storing user data securely in cookies for efficient session management.
dotenv: Facilitates the use of environment variables, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.
JSON Web Token (JWT): Generates secure tokens for user authentication and authorization.
Getting Started
To get started with the MERN Authentication setup, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone [insert repository link]
Navigate to the project directory: cd mern-authentication
Install the dependencies: npm install
Set up the environment variables:
Create a .env file in the project root directory.
Add the required environment variables in the .env file. For example:
makefile
Copy code
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
Run the application: npm start
Open your browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000.
Custom Error Middleware
This repository also includes a custom error middleware that provides a better error handling experience. In development mode, the error middleware sends a JSON object with a custom message and stack trace. In production mode, it returns null to ensure a cleaner error handling process.
